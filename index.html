			Hi! My name's Ivey and I'm currently a student at San Jos√© State University. I'm studying for Design Studies and am working on my craft for graphic designs and illustrations.
			<br><br>
			Some of my works are inspired by abstract ideas and concept, as well as natural forms and human figures. I take most of my inspiration through figure drawings and line formation. Most of my personal works are character concepts and story design.
			<br><br>
			I primarily use Clip Studio Paint for personal illustrations and digital artworks, but I use Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for assignments and other class projects.
